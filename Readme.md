## About

We developed a mobile application (APK) to help cosplayers and beginners in cosplay. The main feature is character photo scanning, which provides a list of costume rental places according to the scanned character. The goal is to make it easier to find costumes quickly and accurately. The app provides complete information about costume providers, including reviews, prices, and locations. The hope is that this app will make it easier for cosplayers to find and rent costumes as needed.


## Background

Cosplay stands for "costume” and “play". It is an activity in which participants, called cosplayers, wear costumes and accessories representing characters from manga, anime, films, comic books or video games. Cosplay often involves a maximum effort to imitate the appearance and lifestyle of the chosen character.

## What's so special about Necosu
When using the Necosu apk, what we can do is search for the name of the rental place or costume that we want to search for or we can use the character image scan feature that we have, the exact rental or costume that matches the image that has been scanned using the "select image" feature will appear. " and select the image of the character whose image you want to scan so that the costume you want to rent will appear and then select "search product", then when the costume or rental place appears, we can immediately check out the costume by selecting the payment method and then if you have selected the payment method then a notification will appear "Payment successful"
